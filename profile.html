        <h3>Why I chose coding as my career</h3>

        <ul>
            <li> I like to figure out the puzzle and put it together </li>
            <li> Being able to create anything your mind can think of is powerful</li>
            <li> Money of course $$$</li>
            <li> Dated a guy that made me do it and then I actually started to really like it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> My ultimate life goal is to work remote for a company while living abroad and traveling. In addition, continue to develop the website I am going to start creating for my capstone. The end goal is to have a fully functioning app to go along with the website so I can do beta testing and then release it for companies to use.  </p>

        <h3>Why I love Crossfit</h3>
        <p>Crossfit is a sport of its own. You think you know fitness, until you try Crossfit. This is a sport that is built around a community of people that range in athletic capabilities. You have seasoned veterans that perform moves you could never dream of, to people that are just picking up the barbell for the first time</p>
        <p> Crossfit is where a group of like-minded individuals come together to perform crazy intense workouts. One of the sayings at my gym is to "embrace the suck" because everyone surrounding you is also in pain. I never dreamed I would pay for someone to push me to the brink of death five days a week. One of my life mantras is "become comfortable with being uncomfortable."
