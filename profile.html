        <h3>Why I chose coding as my career</h3>

        <ul>
            <li> I love puzzles and trying to get all the pieces to fit together </li>
            <li> Being able to create anything your mind can think of is extremely powerful</li>
            <li> Dated a guy that made me do it and then I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Money of course *insert chorus from "The O'Jays - For The Love Of Money" here* (hahaha)</li>
        </ul>

        <p> My ultimate life goal is to work remote for a company while living abroad and traveling. In addition, continue to develop the website I am creating for my capstone. The end goal is to have a fully functioning app to go along with the website so I can do beta testing and then release it for companies to use. </p>


        <h3>My only hobbie and why I let it be my personality :)</h3>
        <p>Crossfit is a sport of its own. You think you know fitness, until you try Crossfit. This is a sport that is built around a community of people that range in athletic capabilities. You have seasoned veterans that perform moves you could never dream of, to people that are just picking up the barbell for the first time</p>
        <p> Crossfit is where a group of like-minded individuals come together to perform crazy intense workouts. One of the sayings at my gym is to "embrace the suck" because everyone surrounding you is also in pain. I never dreamed I would pay for someone to push me to the brink of death five days a week. One of my life mantras is "become comfortable with being uncomfortable."

    <p> I am sure you have noticed, but I love to laugh and make other people laugh. If there is ever a moment where I can attempt to put a smile on someone's face, I will take it. Laughter keeps me going :) </p>
